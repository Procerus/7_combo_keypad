# 7_combo_keypad

The keypad.h file is included here with the keypad.zip, just go into the setting for include libraries and include the zip file.

Right now the code is set for 7 digits but that number can be changed to be up to 64 or more digits however not all of them will appear on the lcd screen.

To change how many you type in just replace every 7 in the code with whatever amount of digits you want.
